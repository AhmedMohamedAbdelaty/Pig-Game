# Description

The Pig Game allows two players to take turns rolling a virtual dice. The objective is to reach a score of 100 before the opponent. Each roll adds the rolled value to the current score, but rolling a 1 resets the current score to zero. Players can choose to hold their current score and switch turns, or keep rolling to potentially score higher but risk losing everything if another 1 is rolled.

# Features

- **Two player support**: Each player has their own score and current score displayed.
- **Dice rolling and score calculation**: A single dice image is updated based on the rolled value, and the score is dynamically adjusted according to the rules.
- **Hold functionality**: Clicking the "Hold" button adds the current score to the player's total and switches turns.
- **Win detection**: If a player reaches 100, they are declared the winner, their section is highlighted, and the "Roll Dice" and "Hold" buttons become disabled.
- **New game functionality**: Clicking the "New Game" button resets all scores, turns, and winner highlights, allowing players to start a new round.

# Challenges Overcome

- **DOM Manipulation**: Effectively manipulated DOM elements to update scores, dice images, and winner highlights.
- **Event Handling**: Attached event listeners to buttons to trigger actions based on user interactions.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Divided the game logic into reusable functions for better organization and maintainability.

# Areas for Improvement

- **Sound effects**: Adding sound effects for dice rolls and score updates could create a more immersive gameplay environment.
- **Difficulty levels**: Introducing adjustable difficulty levels with different winning scores or additional rules could cater to players of varying skill levels.
- **Multiplayer support**: Currently, the game only supports local two-player mode. Exploring online multiplayer functionality would significantly expand its reach and engagement.
